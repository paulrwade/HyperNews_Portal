<p>In programming, it's often useful to know alternative ways to implement something. It not only shows your knowledge and creative analytical thinking, sometimes one implementation just fits better for some reason like the time it takes to execute or memory it needs. Also, as you probably know already, that reason is often the number of lines of code. So, in this topic, we'll learn a great alternative to small functions!</p>

<p>Imagine that you want to write a function that takes a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8804" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, numbers are a data type that can represent both real and abstract quantities. | They are essential for programming and can be used in various contexts such as counting, measuring, and performing mathematical operations. Python has different types of numbers, including integers (int) and floating-point numbers (float). Integers are whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero, without a decimal point. Floats, on the other hand, represent real numbers and have a decimal point. Although they can represent the same value, integers and floats are different objects in Python, and the code checks them for identity, not equality. To compare numbers in Python, you can define methods that allow for smooth comparison. Additionally, Python provides dunder methods, also known as magic methods, that are useful when you want to introduce math in your class.">number</a> and doubles it. If you already know how to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, define refers to the act of creating a new variable, function, class, or module. | When you define an entity in Python, you give it a name and specify its behavior, which can then be used and reused throughout your code. For instance, when you define a function, you specify its parameters (i.e., variables that act as placeholders for arguments) in the function signature, and these parameters can have default values. When the function is called, the arguments passed in the function call are assigned to the corresponding parameters.">define</a> functions in Python using the <strong>def </strong>keyword, you will probably write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def doubler(x):
    return 2 * x</code></pre>
<p>Well, there is actually another way to define such small functions in Python using the <strong>lambda </strong>keyword. The following function is completely equivalent to the one defined above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lambda x: 2 * x</code></pre>
<p>This function doesn't have a name and is, therefore, called <strong>anonymous</strong>. Since in Python <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an anonymous function is a function defined without a name, using the `lambda` keyword. | It can take any number of arguments, separated by commas, but it must consist of a single expression, which is evaluated and returned. Anonymous functions are often handy for one-time use or when combined with other functions. They are particularly useful in situations where defining a full function using the `def` keyword would be overkill. Anonymous functions are also known as lambda functions.">anonymous functions</a> are declared with the <strong>lambda</strong><strong> </strong>keyword, they are often referred to as<strong> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8122" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a lambda function is an anonymous function that is defined using the `lambda` keyword, and it can take any number of arguments, but can only contain a single expression. | Lambda functions are useful for one-time use or when combined with other functions. They are called anonymous because they are defined without a name, and their main purpose is to make coding simpler and more efficient for small, simple functions that are used only once or a few times in a program.">lambda functions</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the syntax in its general form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lambda arguments: expression </code></pre>
<p>A lambda function can take any number of arguments separated by commas, but it must consist of a <em>single </em><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15664" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an expression is a valid construct in the language that can be evaluated to a value. | This can include a wide range of elements, such as strings in parentheses, object types, mathematical expressions, and even function calls. Expressions are used in function annotations, where they can follow a parameter and provide information about the type or expected value of that parameter.">expression</a>. This expression is evaluated and the result is returned. Note that you do not need the <strong>return</strong> statement here. For example, the following anonymous function computes the remainder of the division of the sum of two numbers by two:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2</code></pre>
<p>In case you want to put a condition in some lambda function, you'll have to use the so-called <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a ternary operator, also known as a conditional expression, is a concise way to write an if-else statement in one line. | It has the syntax: `value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. The operation order follows a left-to-right convention, and the code should still be readable and maintainable. The condition is always a boolean expression, and the ternary operator allows for a block of code to be executed only if a specified condition is true.">ternary operator</a> <code class="language-python">first_alternative if condition else second_alternative</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Yes
lambda x: 'even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd'

# No
lambda x:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return 'even'

<p>Classic <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a conditional statement is a block of code that is executed only if a specified condition is true. | The condition is always a boolean expression, which means it can have a value of either true or false. The 'if' statement is followed by a colon and a block of code that will be executed if the condition is met. Proper indentation is crucial for the 'if' statement to work correctly. It is a fundamental tool in programming that allows for more complex logic and decision-making within a program. An 'if-else' statement is a type of conditional expression in Python that differs from an 'if' statement by the presence of the additional keyword.">conditional statements</a> will not work within a lambda function.</p>
<h5 id="invoking-a-lambda-function">Invoking a lambda function</h5>
<p>Alright, but how do we call such a function if it does not have a name?</p>
<p>Python syntax allows us to do so by enclosing the function in brackets and passing arguments right away:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">(lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2)(1, 5)
# The output is 0</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, it is also possible to assign a function object to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">func = lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2
func(1, 10)
# The output is 1</code></pre>
<p>However, assigning an anonymous function does not comply with the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">official style guidelines</a>. It's reasonable to declare your function explicitly with the <strong>def</strong> keyword in case you want it to have a name.</p>
<h5 id="when-is-it-useful">When is it useful?</h5>
<p>You might have noticed already that the function from our example above is fully equivalent to a 'normal' function defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def my_func(x, y):
    return (x + y) % 2</code></pre>
<p>But if we can always use a normal function instead, why are lambda functions useful? </p>
<p>Well, lambda functions are handy, for example, when you use them in combination with another function. Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def create_function(n):
    return lambda x: n * x</code></pre>
<p>The function <code class="language-python">create_function</code> takes one <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an argument is a value that is passed into a function when it is called. | It is used to provide data to the function so that it can perform its intended task. Arguments can be passed either positionally or by keyword, and they can be required or optional. When defining a function, you can specify default values for optional arguments, which allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept. In the context of files, the argument is used to specify where the function will write the given object to. By default, it is set to the standard output stream that prints the object on the screen. However, you can specify a file parameter with the name of the required file, which should be opened in advance and closed when you are done.">argument</a>, number <em>n</em>, and returns a function that multiplies any given number <em>x</em> by that <em>n</em>. You can use it further in your program to quickly define a bunch of functions, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Creating a function that doubles its argument
doubler = create_function(2)

# This function will triple its argument
tripler = create_function(3)

doubler(2)
# Outputs 4

tripler(2)
# Outputs 6</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the functions <code class="language-python">doubler()</code> and <code class="language-python">tripler()</code> are designed rather uniformly: they take a single argument and return it multiplied by <em>2</em> and <em>3</em> respectively. Thus, lambda functions can be embedded into a larger function, like <code class="language-python">create_function()</code> in our example.</p>
