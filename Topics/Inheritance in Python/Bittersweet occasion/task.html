<p>Mysterious things have happened on the Hogwarts Express! Someone enchanted a food trolley and all the goodies got mixed up on the shelves. While the trolley witch is looking for the culprit, you will place <code class="java">Drinks</code>, <code class="java">Pastry</code> and <code class="java">Sweets</code> on three respective shelves.</p>
<p>These three are base classes and have various unknown children: for example, <code class="java">PumpkinJuice</code> inherits from <code class="java">Drinks</code>. Write a function that finds a parent class for an <strong>unknown class </strong>(not an instance of a class) stored in the variable <code class="java">child</code> and <strong>prints out</strong> the parent's name.</p>
<p>Note: all these classes are already created, you don't need to do that yourself. You only need to work with the <code class="java">child</code>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> You can use the <code class="java">issubclass()</code> function to check if a particular class is the parent class and <code class="java">class.__name__</code> to print out the name of a class.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
