<p>One of the main principles of object-oriented programming is <strong>inheritance. </strong>In this topic, we'll focus on inheritance in Python: what it means and how it's done.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-inheritance" style="text-align: center;">What is inheritance?</h5>
<p>Inheritance is a mechanism that allows classes to inherit methods or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/16213" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a property is an attribute that is implemented to have accessor methods (getter and setter methods). | These methods are automatically called when the property is accessed or modified, allowing you to control and validate the data that is associated with the property. This feature is useful for implementing encapsulation in object-oriented programming, where you want to hide the internal representation of an object and only expose a controlled interface to interact with it. By using properties, you can change the implementation of the attribute without affecting the code that uses it, making your code more maintainable and flexible.">properties</a> from other classes. Or, in other words, inheritance is a mechanism of deriving new classes from existing ones.</p>
<p>The purpose of inheritance is to reuse existing code. Often, objects of one class may resemble objects of another class, so instead of rewriting the same methods and attributes, we can make one class inherit those methods and attributes from another class.</p>
<p>When we talk about inheritance, the terminology resembles biological inheritance: we have <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a child class, also known as a derived class or subclass, is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a parent class, also known as a base class or superclass. | Child classes can override or extend the functionality of their parent class, and they can also inherit the functionality of multiple parent classes in the case of multiple inheritance. This allows for code reusability and a more organized class hierarchy, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In the provided context, the child class is referred to as a class that inherits from other classes, specifically a class that inherits from both 'class' and 'class', making it a case of multiple inheritance.">child classes</a> (</strong>or<strong> subclasses, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a derived class (also known as a child class or subclass) is a class that inherits attributes and methods from another class, known as the base class or parent class. | This mechanism of inheritance allows for code reusability and promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. In a class hierarchy, the arrow points from the child class to the parent class, and a child class can have multiple parent classes, resulting in multiple inheritance. When passing an object of a derived class as a function argument, type hints can be used to ensure that the correct type of object is being passed.">derived classes</a>) </strong>that inherit methods or variables from <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a parent class, also known as a base class, is a class that serves as the foundation for other classes, which are referred to as child classes or derived classes. | These child classes inherit methods and attributes from their parent class. In cases of multiple inheritance, a class can have more than one parent class, allowing for complex class hierarchies. It is important to call the parent implementation when overriding methods in order to avoid unexpected consequences and to ensure the original implementation and any enhancements coexist.">parent classes</a> </strong>(or <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11680" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a base class (also known as a parent class or superclass) is a class that serves as the foundation for other classes, known as derived classes or subclasses. | These derived classes inherit attributes and methods from the base class. Base classes can be used to establish a hierarchy of classes, where the base class provides a general definition, and the derived classes provide more specific definitions. A base class can also define abstract methods, which must be implemented by any derived classes. The `abc` module in Python provides tools for creating abstract base classes.">base classes</a>, <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7629" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a superclass is a class that is inherited by another class, also known as a subclass. | It provides a template for the subclass, providing it with attributes and methods that can be used as is or overridden for a more specialized use case. The `super()` function is used to call a method from a superclass in the context of a subclass. In a class hierarchy, arrows point from the child class to the parent class, indicating that the child class inherits from the parent class.">superclasses</a>). </strong>Child classes can also redefine methods of the parent class if necessary.</p>
<h5 id="class-object" style="text-align: center;">Class object</h5>
<p>Inheritance is very easy to implement in your programs. Any class can be a parent class, so all we need to do is to write the name of the parent class in <strong>parentheses </strong>after the child class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># inheritance syntax
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # methods and attributes
    ...</code></pre>
<p>The definition of the parent class should precede the definition of the child class, otherwise, you'll get a <code class="language-python">NameError</code>! If a class has several subclasses, its definition should precede them all. The "sibling" classes can be defined in any order.</p>
<p>When we don't define a parent for our class, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have any! By default, all classes have the class <code class="language-python">object</code> as their parent. In Python 3.x we don't need to explicitly indicate that, so the definitions below are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># parent class is explicit
class SomeClass(object):
    # methods and attributes
    ...


# parent class is implicit
class SomeClass:
    # methods and attributes
    ...</code></pre>
<p>Subclasses of <code class="language-python">object</code> inherit its methods and attributes. So, all standard methods like <code class="language-python">__init__</code> or <code class="language-python">__repr__</code> are inherited from the class <code class="language-python">object</code>. If we don't redefine those methods for our custom classes, we end up using their implementations defined for the <code class="language-python">object</code> class.</p>
<h5 id="single-inheritance" style="text-align: center;">Single inheritance</h5>
<p>Unlike some other programming languages, Python supports two forms of inheritance: <strong>single </strong>and<strong> multiple.</strong> <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, single inheritance refers to a child class acquiring properties and methods from a single parent class. | This means that the child class inherits attributes and behaviors of the parent class, and can also define its own unique attributes and methods. The child class can override or extend methods inherited from the parent class, providing a way to customize and specialize the behavior of the parent class. This concept enables code reuse and a more organized code structure, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.">Single inheritance</a> </strong>is when a child class inherits from one parent class. <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7657" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, multiple inheritance is a mechanism where a class has two or more parent classes from which it inherits attributes and behaviors. | This is different from single inheritance where a class only inherits from one parent class. In code, multiple inheritance is implemented by listing all parent classes in brackets after the child class. However, multiple inheritance can sometimes lead to a complication known as the diamond problem. The diamond problem is an ambiguity that arises when a class inherits from two classes that have a common parent class, leading to confusion about which attributes and methods to inherit.">Multiple inheritance</a> </strong>is when a child class inherits from multiple parent classes. In this topic, we'll cover only single inheritance. Don't worry, though, you'll have a chance to learn about multiple inheritance in the next topics!</p>
<p>Let's consider an example of single inheritance.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># parent class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

# child class
class Dog(Animal):
    pass</code></pre>
<p>Here we have a base class <code class="language-python">Animal</code> with the <code class="language-python">__init__</code> method and a subclass <code class="language-python">Dog</code> that inherits from the base class. The keyword <code class="language-python">pass</code> allows us not to write anything in the definition of the child class.</p>
<p>Now that we've defined classes, we can create objects:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">cow = Animal("Bessie")  # instance of Animal
corgi = Dog("Baxter")   # instance of Dog</code></pre>
<p>We haven't defined the <code class="language-python">__init__</code> for the class <code class="language-python">Dog</code> but since it's a child of <code class="language-python">Animal</code>, it inherited its <code class="language-python">__init__</code>. So if we tried to declare an instance of the class <code class="language-python">Dog</code> in a different way, we would get an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">labrador = Dog()  # TypeError</code></pre>
<h5 id="type-vs-isinstance" style="text-align: center;">type() vs isinstance()</h5>
<p>There are two main ways to check the type of an object: <code class="language-python">type()</code> or <code class="language-python">isinstance()</code> functions.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-python">type()</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a callable block of code that performs a specific task. | It can take zero or more arguments as input, process them, and optionally return a result. Functions provide structure to your code and make it more reusable. They are first-class entities in Python, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions. This feature enables the creation of higher-order functions, which can take functions as input or return functions as output.">function</a> takes one <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5891" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an argument is a value that is passed into a function when it is called. | It is used to provide data to the function so that it can perform its intended task. Arguments can be passed either positionally or by keyword, and they can be required or optional. When defining a function, you can specify default values for optional arguments, which allows the function to be called with fewer arguments than it is defined to accept. In the context of files, the argument is used to specify where the function will write the given object to. By default, it is set to the standard output stream that prints the object on the screen. However, you can specify a file parameter with the name of the required file, which should be opened in advance and closed when you are done.">argument</a>, an object, and returns its type. The <code class="language-python">isinstance()</code> function takes two arguments: an object and a class. It checks if the given object is an instance of the given class and returns a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10327" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a boolean value is a special data type that can have only two possible values: True or False. | These values are used to represent the two opposite states of something, such as on or off, yes or no. The values of non-boolean types, such as integers or strings, are called truthy or falsy, depending on whether they are interpreted as true or false. In Python, the following values are evaluated as false: constant defined to be false (None), zero of any numeric type (0, 0.0, 0j), empty sequences and containers ([], (), {}, set()), and empty strings ('', b''). Anything else generally evaluates to true.">boolean value</a>.</p>
<p>For built-in types, they work the same, but when inheritance is involved, their results are different. Let's check it out!</p>
<p>First, let's look at the <code class="language-python">type()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(type(cow) == Animal)  # True
print(type(corgi) == Animal)  # False

print(type(cow) == Dog)     # False
print(type(corgi) == Dog)     # True
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this allows us to check for the immediate type of the object. Now, <code class="language-python">isinstance()</code> works differently:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(isinstance(cow, Animal))    # True
print(isinstance(corgi, Animal))  # True

print(isinstance(cow, Dog))    # False
print(isinstance(corgi, Dog))  # True</code></pre>
<p>With this, we get <code class="language-python">True</code> not only with the immediate type but also with the parent type and it would work even with the parent of the parent type! This distinction is important to remember for future projects!</p>
<h5 id="issubclass" style="text-align: center;">issubclass()</h5>
<p>While <code class="language-python">isinstance()</code> checks the type of an instance of a class, another built-in function asks whether a given class is a subclass of another class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(issubclass(Dog, Animal))  # True
print(issubclass(Animal, Dog))  # False

print(issubclass(Dog, Dog))     # True
print(issubclass(corgi, Dog))   # TypeError</code></pre>
<p>As shown, the <code class="language-python">issubclass()</code> function returns <code class="language-python">True</code> if the first class inherits from the second class, and <code class="language-python">False</code> otherwise. Each class is considered a subclass of itself. Notice that the function can't work with instances of a class, both its arguments should be classes. However, you can use a tuple of classes to check if your class inherits from any of the several classes in the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7462" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a tuple is a type of data structure that is similar to a list, but with some key differences. | Like lists, tuples can contain multiple items, and these items can be of different data types. Tuples are defined using parentheses, with items separated by commas. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This immutability is one of the key advantages of tuples, as it makes them faster and more memory-efficient than lists. Additionally, because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot. Tuples share many of the same operations as lists, such as addition, multiplication, and the ability to be nested. However, because tuples are immutable, operations like item assignment are not possible. Instead, tuples can be unpacked, allowing for the assignment of multiple variables at once.">tuple</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(issubclass(Dog, object))            # True
print(issubclass(Dog, (Animal, object)))  # True</code></pre>
<p>The case with several classes might be somewhat misleading, though. The thing is that the function checks whether <em>any</em> element of the tuple is a parent. Say, we have defined a new class <code class="language-python">Robot</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class Robot:
    pass</code></pre>
<p>Then <code class="language-python">issubclass()</code> will return the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(issubclass(Dog, Robot))            # False
print(issubclass(Dog, (Robot, Animal)))  # True</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code class="language-python">Dog</code> has nothing to do with <code class="language-python">Robot</code>, in the last case, we got <code class="language-python">True</code>. So keep this detail in mind when calling this function!</p>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>As one of the pillars of OOP, inheritance is very important! In Python, declaring parent classes is quite simple and straightforward. In this topic, we've covered the basics of the inheritance in Python: how it's done, what is class <code class="language-python">object</code>, how to define a single parent for the class, and then check the type of an object or a class without any mistakes.</p>
<p>Inheritance is what really makes classes so powerful and useful. It also allows programmers to stick to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and pushes them to think about the effectiveness and clarity of their classes.</p>
