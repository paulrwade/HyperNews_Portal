<h2>Tuple</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>By now, you definitely know how to handle a list, the most popular collection in Python. Now let's discover an equally useful data type — <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9439" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a tuple is a type of data structure that is similar to a list, but with some key differences. | Like lists, tuples can contain multiple items, and these items can be of different data types. Tuples are defined using parentheses, with items separated by commas. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning that once they are created, their contents cannot be changed. This immutability is one of the key advantages of tuples, as it makes them faster and more memory-efficient than lists. Additionally, because tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot. Tuples share many of the same operations as lists, such as addition, multiplication, and the ability to be nested. However, because tuples are immutable, operations like item assignment are not possible. Instead, tuples can be unpacked, allowing for the assignment of multiple variables at once.">tuples</a></strong>. You should remember that they are almost identical to lists. What <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6643" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a set is a collection of unique, hashable objects that are unordered and mutable. | Sets allow you to perform mathematical set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference. You can create sets using curly braces or the set() function, and add elements using the add() or update() methods. Sets can help you avoid repetition and are useful when you need to run membership tests quickly. An empty set can be created using the set() function without any arguments. Sets are different from lists because the order of elements does not matter, and they do not allow duplicate elements.">sets</a> them apart is their <strong>immutability</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="define-a-tuple">Define a tuple</h5>
<p>Since tuples cannot be changed, tuple creation is similar to opening a box of a fixed size, then putting several values into this box and sealing it. Once the box has been sealed, you cannot modify its size or content.</p>
<p>Use a pair of <strong>parentheses </strong>to define a tuple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">empty_tuple = ()
print(type(empty_tuple))  # &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Empty tuples are easy to create. Then what went wrong in the following example?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">not_a_tuple = ('cat')
print(not_a_tuple)        # 'cat'
print(type(not_a_tuple))  # &lt;class 'str'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the variable we created stores a string. It's actually a <strong>comma </strong>that makes a tuple, not parentheses. Let's fix this piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">now_a_tuple = ('cat',)
print(now_a_tuple)        # ('cat',)
print(type(now_a_tuple))  # &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So, always use a comma when defining a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8077" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a singleton is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance. | This is useful when you want to ensure that a class has only one object, providing a global access point to this object. In the context provided, it's mentioned that default values for optional arguments in a function, such as `None`, are singletons. This means that they always refer to the same object throughout the program. Additionally, the `True` and `False` booleans are also singletons, ensuring that there is only one instance of each in Python.">singleton</a> tuple. In fact, even if your tuple contains more than one element, separating items with commas will be enough:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">weekend = 'Saturday', 'Sunday'
print(weekend)        # ('Saturday', 'Sunday')
print(type(weekend))  # &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The built-in function <code class="language-python">tuple()</code> turns strings, lists and other <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8479" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an iterable is a data type that can be iterated over, meaning it can be looped through to access its individual elements one at a time. | Iterables include data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. They can be used with for loops and other functions that require an iterable object, such as the built-in function `zip()`. An iterator, on the other hand, is an object that can be iterated over and returns one element at a time. It is created from an iterable using the built-in function `iter()` and can be manually advanced using the `next()` function. In the provided context, it is mentioned that iterators represent a stream of data and implement the `__next__()` method, which returns the next item of an iterable one by one. An iterator can be created from an iterable by passing it to the built-in function `iter()`. When an iterator is passed to the `next()` function, it returns the next element of the iterable. However, once all elements of an iterable have been returned, attempting to call `next()` on the iterator will raise a `StopIteration` exception. It is also mentioned that when using a for loop, Python automatically creates an iterator from a given iterable and retrieves its elements one by one. The `zip()` function can be used to take multiple iterables and combine them into a single iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains one element from each iterable.">iterables</a> </strong>into a tuple. With this function, you can create an empty tuple as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># another empty tuple
empty_tuple = tuple()
print(empty_tuple)        # ()
print(type(empty_tuple))  # &lt;class 'tuple'&gt;

# a list turned into a tuple
bakers_dozen = tuple([12, 1])
print(bakers_dozen == (12, 1))  # True

# a tuple from a string
sound = tuple('meow')
print(sound)  # ('m', 'e', 'o', 'w')</code></pre>
<h5 id="what-can-we-do-with-tuples">What can we do with tuples?</h5>
<p>First, let's examine what characteristics lists and tuples have in common.</p>
<p>Both lists and tuples are <strong>ordered</strong>, that is, when passing elements to these containers, you can expect that their order will remain the same. Tuples are also indifferent to the nature of data stored in them, so you can <strong>duplicate values</strong> or <strong>mix different <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5852" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a data type is a classification of data that determines how it is stored in memory, what operations can be performed on it, and how those operations are executed. | It is similar to a biological species or any other abstract attribute shared among specific objects. For example, all dogs you've seen have the type dog, but each is an individual object. When it comes to Python, data types include basic data types such as strings, numerical types, and printing types. When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates a new object, places the value inside the object, and then creates a reference from the variable name to the object.">data types</a></strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">tiny_tuple = (0, 1, 0, 'panda', 'sloth')

print(len(tiny_tuple))  # 5
print(tiny_tuple)       # (0, 1, 0, 'panda', 'sloth')</code></pre>
<p>Just like lists, tuples support <strong>indexing</strong>. Be careful with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6189" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an index refers to the position of an element in a sequence such as a list, tuple, or string. | It is used to access individual elements of a sequence by their position, with the first index being 0. Negative indexing is also supported, where -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on. Indexing is a fundamental concept in Python programming, and it is used extensively in various operations such as slicing, where a subset of a sequence can be extracted using indexing.">indexes</a> though, if you want to get along without <code class="language-python">IndexErrors</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">empty_tuple = ()
print(empty_tuple[0])  # IndexError

numbers = (0, 1, 2)
print(numbers[0])   # 0
print(numbers[1])   # 1
print(numbers[2])   # 2
print(numbers[3])   # IndexError</code></pre>
<p>And here the first distinctive feature of tuples comes into play. What they don't support is <strong>item assignment</strong>. While you can change an element in a list referring to this element by its index, it's not the case for tuples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># ex-capitals
capitals = ['Philadelphia', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'Saint Petersburg']

capitals[0] = 'Washington, D.C.'
capitals[1] = 'Brasília'
capitals[2] = 'Moscow'
print(capitals)  # ['Washington, D.C.', 'Brasília', 'Moscow']

former_capitals = tuple(capitals)
former_capitals[0] = 'Washington, D.C.'  # TypeError</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we tried to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6230" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an update refers to the action of adding or modifying existing key-value pairs in a dictionary. | This can be done using the `update()` method, which allows you to add new elements to a dictionary from another dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs. If the specified key already exists in the dictionary, the method will update the key with the new value. This is particularly useful when working with dynamic data or when you want to merge two dictionaries together.">update</a> the tuple and it didn't end well. You can't add an item to a tuple or <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/36298" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, the term remove is used in the context of removing elements from a collection such as a list or a dictionary. | For a list, the `remove()` method is used to remove the first occurrence of an item based on its value. If the item is not in the list, it will raise a `ValueError`. Alternatively, you can remove an item from a list by its index using the `del` keyword. For a dictionary, the `pop()` method is used to remove a key-value pair and return the associated value. The `clear()` method can be used to remove all items from a dictionary.">remove</a> it from there (unless you <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8681" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a delete refers to the action of removing or eliminating data. | In the context of working with databases using Python, delete is a statement used to remove rows of data from a table. It's important to note that delete operations are permanent and cannot be undone. Before executing a delete statement, it's a best practice to carefully consider the implications of removing the data.">delete</a> the entire tuple). However, immutability has a positive side. We'll discuss it in the next section.</p>
<h5 id="immutability-and-its-advantages">Immutability and its advantages</h5>
<p>By this time, one question might have come to your mind: why use tuples when we have lists? Predictably, all answers conduce to immutability. Let's dwell on its upsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tuples are <strong>faster </strong>and <strong>more memory-efficient</strong> than lists. Whenever you need to work with large amounts of data, you should give it a thought. If you are not going to modify your data, perhaps you should decide on tuples.</li>
<li>A tuple can be used as a <strong>dictionary key</strong>, whereas lists as keys will result in <code class="language-python">TypeError</code>.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it's <strong>impossible to change</strong> by accident the data stored in a tuple. It may prove a safe and robust solution to some tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those were the very basics of tuples in Python. Just like lists, tuples are <strong>ordered </strong>and <strong>iterable</strong>. Unlike lists, they are <strong>immutable</strong>. You'll learn more of tuple features in the next topics, now it's time to write your first programs with them!</p>
