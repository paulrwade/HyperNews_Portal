<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>We have a file <strong>numbers.txt </strong>that contains a single line with the number 1. Suppose, we run the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('numbers.txt', 'a')

for i in range(2, 11):
    file.write(str(i) + ' ')

file.close()</code></pre>
<p>How many lines will <strong>numbers.txt </strong> contain after this?</p>
