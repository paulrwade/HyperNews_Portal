<h2>Reading files</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>If you have a file, you might want to view its contents. In this topic, you'll learn different ways to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8691" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a read file refers to the process of obtaining data from a file and storing it in a variable as a string. | This can be done using various methods, such as read(), readline(), and readlines(), which are all methods of a file object. The read() method reads the entire file into a single string, while readline() reads a single line from the file, and readlines() reads all the lines in the file and returns them as a list of strings. When reading a file, it is important to open it in reading mode using the 'r' parameter.">read files</a> in Python.</p>

<p>To <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11724" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, reading refers to the process of obtaining and interpreting data from a source. | In the context of your question, reading is specifically used when working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. The Python csv library provides functionalities for reading and writing CSV files, which are commonly used for data entry and storage. The csv library includes a reader function that can be used to read CSV files and convert them into a dictionary, making it easier to access and manipulate the data.">read</a> the file, first we need to open it in the reading mode. Now that the file is opened, how does the actual reading part go? Let's first choose a file that we want to read. So, imagine we have a file called '<strong>animals.txt' </strong>that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Dog
Cat
Rabbit
Sea turtle
Penguin</code></pre>
<p>To read the file, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the <code class="language-python">read(size)</code> method;</li>
<li>use the <code class="language-python">readline(size)</code>  method;</li>
<li>use the <code class="language-python">readlines()</code>  method;</li>
<li>iterate over the lines with a <code class="language-python">for</code> loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three ways are special <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8691" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a file object is an object that represents a file in your computer's file system. | It is created using the built-in `open()` function, which takes a path-like object as its required parameter. This path-like object is typically a string that specifies the file's location in the file directory. Once you've opened a file, you can use various methods on the resulting file object to read from or write to the file. The `open()` function has several optional parameters, one of which is the `mode` parameter. This parameter determines how the file is opened and what you can do with it. For example, if you open a file in read mode (`'r'`), you can only read from the file, while if you open it in write mode (`'w'`), you can write to the file, and if the file already exists, its contents will be overwritten.">file object</a> methods while the last one is a general Python loop. Let's go over them one by one.</p>
<h5 id="read" style="text-align: center;">read()</h5>
<p><code class="language-python">read(size)</code> reads the <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes of a file. If the parameter isn't specified, the whole file is read into a single variable. So, this is what we'll get if we apply it to our file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.read())
# The output:
# Dog
# Cat
# Rabbit
# Sea turtle
# Penguin

file.close()</code></pre>
<h5 id="readline" style="text-align: center;">readline()</h5>
<p><code class="language-python">readline(size)</code> is similar to <code class="language-python">read(size)</code> but it reads <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes from a single line, not the whole file. Lines in files are separated by <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8334" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a newline is a special character used to indicate the end of a line in a text file or a string. | It is represented as a backslash followed by the letter 'n' (\n). When a newline is encountered, the cursor moves to the beginning of the next line. This allows for the organization of text into multiple lines, making it easier to read and understand. In the context of writing a list of names to a file, each name would be followed by a newline character, resulting in each name appearing on a separate line in the file.">newline</a></strong> escape sequences: <code class="language-python">'\n'</code>, <code class="language-python">'\r'</code> or <code class="language-python">'\r\n'</code>. We'll settle on <code class="language-python">'\n'</code> in this topic. Yet, keep in mind that this <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7130" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an escape sequence is a set of characters used to represent a special character or action within a string. | Escape sequences begin with a backslash (\) followed by a specific character. For example, the escape sequence \n represents a new line, and \t represents a tab. These sequences allow for the formatting of strings in a concise and standardized way. When a string contains an escape sequence, it is treated as a single character for most string methods, such as len(), but is displayed as its corresponding special character when printed.">escape sequence</a> depends on your operating system.</p>
<p>Let's proceed with our example. The file '<strong>animals.txt'</strong> contains 5 lines. Here is what we'll get if we try to read 3 bytes from each line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))
print(file.readline(3))

# The output:
# Dog
# 
# 
# Cat
# 
# 
# Rab
# bit


file.close()</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the output does not contain the first three characters from all 5 lines. This is because when we specify the <code class="language-python">size</code> parameter, we get <code class="language-python">size</code> bytes from the line until it ends and only then go to another line. The newline character is considered as a part of the line here. So, in our example, we need two passes of <code class="language-python">readline(3)</code> to read the first line which has three characters and a newline character (4 bytes in total). This is where all those empty lines in the output come from.</p>
<h5 id="readlines" style="text-align: center;">readlines()</h5>
<p><code class="language-python">readlines()</code> allows us to read the whole file as a list of lines. Here's what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
print(file.readlines())
# The output:
# ['Dog\n', 'Cat\n', 'Rabbit\n', 'Sea turtle\n', 'Penguin']

file.close()</code></pre>
<p>Here you can actually see that the newline character is a part of the line! This method works well when the files are small, but for large files, this may be inefficient.</p>
<h5 id="for-loop" style="text-align: center;">for loop</h5>
<p>The most efficient way to read the contents of a file is to iterate over its lines with <code class="language-python">for</code> loop.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">file = open('animals.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print(line)

# The output:
# Dog
# 
# Cat
# 
# Rabbit
# 
# Sea turtle
# 
# Penguin

file.close() </code></pre>
<p>This is the best way to read large files because we can just work with one line at a time or work with specific lines and discard the rest.</p>
<h5 id="summary" style="text-align: center;">Summary</h5>
<p>So, in this topic, we've seen how to read the file's contents. This skill is quite useful because sometimes it's easier or more convenient to read a file using Python than to open it directly. Again, these are the available ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="language-python">read()</code> method reads the file as a whole;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">readline()</code> reads the file one line at a time;</li>
<li><code class="language-python">readlines()</code> reads the file as a list of lines.</li>
<li>the best way, however, is to use <code class="language-python">for</code> loop to iterate over the lines of the file.</li>
</ul>
